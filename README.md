# Dimensionality-Reduction-using-PCA-and-clustering-using-EM-Algorithm

Principal component analysis (PCA) and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm are two of the most widely used unsupervised methods in machine learning. In this assignment, PCA is used for dimensionality reduction and EM algorithm for Gaussian mixture model is applied to cluster the data with dimensionality reduced.

Detailed program specifications are described in *specification.pdf* inside the *PCA and EM* folder.
